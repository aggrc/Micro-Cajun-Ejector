The Micro Cajun Ejector is a 3-D printable device that supports reproducible cryopreservation with standardizable cooling rates in conjunction with the MVE BL-7 nitrogen vapor shipping dewars. Development of aquatic germplasm repositories to preserve genetic resources is impeded by a lack of standardized, inexpensive, reproducible, and portable cryopreservation technologies. The Micro Cajun Ejector is used in laboratories or field work to cryopreserve sperm, assist in short-term storage and transportation, and is distributed as open hardware.
The Micro Cajun Ejector is a smaller version of the Cajun Ejector tailored specifically to the BL-7 and was developed by the Aquatic Germplasm and Genetic Resources Center (AGGRC) at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center by Brittany Ratliff, Lillian Cherok, Yue Liu, Terrence Tiersch, and colleagues, in partnership with the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) and USDA National Animal Germplasm Program (NAGP). This work was funded primarily by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Program (ORIP). This device is part of a multi-year project for developing a series of open-hardware devices to support development of standardized and reproducible tools for research communities that use aquatic models to study human disease.
Details about the development of the Original Cajun Ejector can be found in the publication: William M. Childress, Yue Liu & Terrence R. Tiersch (2023) Design, alpha testing, and beta testing of a 3-D printed open-hardware portable cryopreservation device for aquatic species, Journal of Applied Aquaculture, 35:1, 213-236. The 3-D files for the Cajun Ejector can be found on the AGGRC website and NIH 3D Print Exchange: https://3d.nih.gov/users/aggrc.lsuac
